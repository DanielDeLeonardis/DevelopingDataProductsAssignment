### Australian General Record of Incidence of Mortality (GRIM) Books

GRIM books house national level, historical and recent deaths data for specific causes of death. The tables present age- and sex-specific counts and rates of deaths, and age-standardised death rates, for all causes and for International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems.

The data used here is is a subset of the published GRIM data set and includes:

- year: The year the deaths occurred
- causeOfDeath: classification of the cause of death
- sex: gender of the deceased (male, female and total)
- deaths: The number of deaths

### How to Use

A drop down dialog box contains a list of causes of death. Choosing a different option will result in the deaths being plotted for the cause of death by year and sex (including the total for both sexes).

Generally a cause of death relates to both sexes. Where there is only one sex related to the cause of death e.g. Prostrate cancer only applies to males, only the plot for the single sex is shown (i.e. the total is not shown). 

Data may not be available for all years for a particular cause of death so the start and end years on the plot will change acconding to the minimum and maximum years in the data set.
